I used HTML and SCSS to code and style the website.

The HTML code is in the root folder of the project

The SCSS styles are in the SASS folder and these are split into separate folders.

SASS folder is broken into to components, layout and util.

The components folder contains the styling for the home and restaurant pages styling for mobile devices.

The layout folder contains the styling for a custom reset stylesheet(base.scss), the media-query.scss contains the styles for tablet and various desktop device sizes, the animations.scss contains the styles for all the animations.

The util folder contains the all my variables and mixins for the website, variables are set for colors and fonts, and mixins for button shadows ect.
